/**
 * This class represents specific time value of logical clock at the given moment of time. This class is immutable. It
 * provides convenient operations for working with logical time.
 *
 * <p>
 * Logical timestamps assigned to each event in the distributed system obey causality, but they can not distinguish
 * concurrent events. Logical timestamps not guaranteed to be ordered or unequal for concurrent events:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * E1 -> E2 => timestamp(E1) < timestamp(E2), but
 * timestamp(E1) < timestamp(E2) => {E1 -> E2} or {E1 and E2 are concurrent}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to identify concurrent events see {@link com.antonkharenko.logicalclocks.VectorTimestamp}.
 *
